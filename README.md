This Data Exploration looks at Pew Research Center's 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study (RLS) Dataset. It seeks to perform preliminary data manipulation with the intent to identify and describe the most important variables, as well provide initial observations about the data. 

For this project, the tidyverse, ggplot2, Hmisc, survey, and knitr packages are used.
